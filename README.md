1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-news-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-news-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

## Redux Integration

Redux is used to manage the application state. The relevant files and folders include:

- **`src/actions`:** Redux action creators.

- **`src/reducers`:** Redux reducers.

- **`src/store`:** Redux store configuration.

- **Connect Components:** Connect your React components to the Redux store using the `connect` function from `react-redux`.

For example, to connect a component:

```jsx
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const YourComponent = ({ yourData, dispatch }) => {
  // Your component logic here
};

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  yourData: state.yourReducer.yourData,
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(YourComponent);
```

For more detailed information on using Redux in your React app, refer to the [Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/).
